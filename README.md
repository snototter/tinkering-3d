# Custom 3D Builds
Collection of my custom 3d builds - cad models + gcode

* *kid-cave*<br/>I built a "cave top" for my kid's bed. These models are used to connect the top to the bed.
* *drip-rail*<br/>In my workshop, a pipe close to a power outlet drips frequently (due to condensation). Although the power outlet is waterproof, I prefer bypassing the condensation drops.
